        <h2>Project Goal</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a script creation tool for simple calculations in order to
             enable people without coding knowledge to create execute mathematical calculations on a computer.
             This system is greatly inspired by Unreal Engine's Blueprint system which is often used for simple
             scripts in games created with Unreal Engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is follows the principle of <b>Model Driven Engineering</b> and makes extensive
             use of Model-to-Model and Model-to-Text tranformations to convert a script created from the
             graphical tool to an executable Python scripts that computes the result.
        </p>

            The image above is an example of a script created to compute
             <i>-max(a, b) + c</i> where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are use inputs and
             <i>c</i> is a constant.
