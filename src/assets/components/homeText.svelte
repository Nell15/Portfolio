        I'm a 19 years old engineering student at N7 (ENSEEIHT)
        specializing in Computer Science. I'm interested in software
        development, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

        My computer science journey started in 10th grade with Arduino when I started taking engineering 
        science classes. Over the years, I made several projects either alone or in a team.

        In september 2023, I enrolled in <a href="https://www.enseeiht.fr/en/index.html" target="_blank">N7 (ENSEEIHT)</a> 
        after, partaking in the engineering schools entrance exam earlier in May of the same year.
