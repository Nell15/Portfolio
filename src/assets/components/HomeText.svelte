        I'm a 19 years old engineering student at N7 (ENSEEIHT)
        specializing in Computer Science. I'm interested in software
        development, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

        My computer science journey started in junior high school when I started learning Scratch for game development.
        This lead to 10th grade when I started taking engineering science classes and learned programming on Arduino boards. 
        Over the years, I have made several projects either alone or in a team, which grew my interest for computer science even more.
